# Tone Generator
A basic RP2040 program which uses the buzzer on a maker board to generate tones, with these tones being changed via buttons on the boards. 

On the maker board, the first button lowers the tone, the second button resets the tone to default, and the third button ups the tone.

The stub for this program can be found linked bellow:
