# RP2040 Coursework
This repository contains the different mini-projects that I completed for my RP2040 coursework.

Projects I created also contain versions with stubs so that others can complete them in their own way. 
These projects include:
- [Pico Image Display](https://github.com/WIP03/RP2040-Coursework/tree/master/Image_Display)
- [TCP Math Parser](https://github.com/WIP03/RP2040-Coursework/tree/master/TCP_Math_Parser)
